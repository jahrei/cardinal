# CARDINAL
"self-correction"

# Linux 
I run Arch Linux as my daily driver. Serves me well. In this repo you can find things that I use to maintain or modify Arch to my liking.

# Other projects
Eventually as I progress more into compsci I will have a lot of projects I will release on here for the world to see. :)
